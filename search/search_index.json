The process of gaining one Sodium takes 20 seconds and consumes 400mB of Water.</p> 2. Potassium Production <p>For this you need a Electrolytic Separator.

Molten Salt Production <p>After you have extracted your sodium and potassium, you still need some thorium! If you dont have some yet, swing your shovel and find some! Then you will need a Salt Melter.  Place it down and apply energy to it though the port on the back. </p> <p>Add your potassium in the top slot, your thorium in the middle one, and your sodium in the bottom slot.  Afterwards your Salt Melter will start heat up to its working temperature and melt it into molten salt fluid  The process of gaining 100mB molten salt takes 40 seconds and consumes one Potassium, Thorium and Sodium each. </p> <p>And there you got your first Molten Salt!</p>"},{"location":"fuel/#enriched-uranium-pellet","title":"Enriched Uranium Pellet","text":"1.

For that, equip your Configurator and right-click on the valves to set them to your desired mode.  Use some kind of pipes/cables to firstly fuel your molten salt though the Fluid Input valve mode in the reactor!  Any size of reactor does atleast need 8.000mB of molten salt to not end up in a scram shutdown!</p> <p>After that, fuel it up with enriched uranium through the Item Input valve mode.  For that you need to open the reactor interface and change the FUEL LOAD value and confirm it with SET.  You will see that the in the valves stored enriched uranium will be consumed by the reactor.  The rod grid in the interface should come up in green after some time!</p> <p>Its very important that you fill up the reactor with atleast 8.000mB molten salt before you fuel it with enriched uranium!

When reaching states over 105% it gets damaged!  Damaging a reactor is obviously a bad idea, don't do it! Don't try it! Never!  Its decreasing the reachable temperature, fluid conversion rate, and even lets radiation escape.  A damaged reactor cannot be repaired! Luckily, a thorium reactor cannot explode!</p> <p>Now simply click on START to activate the reactors physical chain reaction.  The reactor will now heat up to its maximum temperature defined by the current configuration!  Now you can modify the Reactor Load value to savely bring it to 100%. Remember that more uranium means more heat!  When it's heated up, switch from START to RUN! This change will let the reactor heat up the before fueled molten salt into its heated form.  The rate of that transformation is set at 1mB per 50\u00b0C each tick (1 sec = 20 ticks) beginning at 101\u00b0C with 2mB. So e.g. the reactor will generate 20mB/t at 1000\u00b0C!</p> <p>Secondary, a depleted uranium pellet is being spit out each 12 hours of active reactor running time! Make sure, that such can be extracted though valves in Item Output mode.  Otherwise the molten salt conversion and temperature are decreasing drastically!
